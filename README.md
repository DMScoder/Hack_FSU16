*Mastermind: 

A 2D platformer game made for the 30 hour 2016 FSU Hackathon using LibGDX and the Leap Motion API.

Mastermind, at its most basic level, is a two player game where one player is a "god" who can manipulate the level while the other player is a "human" that must complete the level as the god changes it. The god does not want the player to make it to the end. Both sides have certain powers and abilities to manipulate the game so that they are constantly outplaying each other.
